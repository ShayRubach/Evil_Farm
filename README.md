# Game Instructions
-   Every player starts with a  shuffled team (random positions) on a chess-like board.
-   Every player sees his own team weapons and none of the enemies (they all look a like).
-   When a player reaches his turn, he can move his soldier by press+hold it and swipe to the valid locations indicated with the leaf indicators on board. If 2 soldiers are next to each other, steping on other's tile will start a fight.
- Every team has 4 soldiers of each kind, and 1 single <b>Crystal</b> soldier. The currently available weapons (more to be added in the future) are:
-- Pitchfork
-- Axe
-- Club
-- Shield
-- Crystal
<br>
-  Match rules are simple:
-- <b> Pitchfork</b> > <b>Axe</b>
-- <b> Club</b> > <b>Pitchfork</b>
-- <b> Axe</b> > <b>Club</b>
-- <b> Shield</b> > <b> All Weapons</b> , but dies with them.
-   The goal is to find and kill the <b>Crystal Holder</b> (aka the king) .
- If 2 soldiers are having the same weapons, a tie will be called and the soldiers will be asked to choose new weapon for the tie-breaker. In case another tie occurs, same process will be repeated until tie breaks.
- After match ends, the winning soldier will be <b>revealed</b>, and his weapon will be displayed to the rival team.
- If the <b>Crystal Holder</b> has been found and attacked, game ends. 
- Game can be restarted after finished.
